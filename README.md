## Assignment Goals

### Part 1: HTML

- Structure the page using semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
- Ensure that all content is accessible and properly formatted.

### Part 2: CSS

- Create a responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Implement a navigation bar with links.
- Add an image gallery or media section using images or videos.
- Style the typography, colors, and layout of the page using custom CSS.

- Use proper heading hierarchy for readability.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast between text and background.
